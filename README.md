## About Me

Iâ€™m an engineer focused on **tactical edge computing**, **AI automation**, and **secure systems integration**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **networking**, **DevSecOps**, and **mission system design**â€”bridging the gap between enterprise cloud environments and disconnected edge operations.

With over two decades in **defense, aerospace, and IT**, Iâ€™ve developed and deployed systems that combine:

- **Resilient networking and datalink architectures**  
- **Edge orchestration using Kubernetes and containerized workloads**  
- **Autonomous AI agents and automation pipelines**  
- **Operational tools for situational awareness and decision support**

Iâ€™m passionate about **building technology that performs in the real world**, where reliability, simplicity, and resilience matter most.
